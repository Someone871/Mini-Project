In this project we have created an application which is easy to access and user friendly. For this application we used the backend as MySQL to store the data, for the middleware we have used Java and for the user interface we have used JSP, CSS and Bootstrap.

This application is designed to be used by three types of users - Customer, Chef and Delivery Executive. 

The Customer can order food from various chefs present within his zone. (A Zone is a group of areas within the city).

The Chef can accept orders and set his menu for the day.

The Delivery Executive can view the orders he has to deliver and can update the Order's status after delivering it.
